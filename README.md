This project showcases a customizable Heat Haze (heat distortion) effect implemented in Unity 6.1 using the Built-in Render Pipeline (BiRP). The effect creates a dynamic visual distortion that simulates the shimmering air typical of hot environments.

## Key features:
Camera-based radius limitation — The heat distortion only appears within a defined distance from the camera, creating a focused effect zone that follows the player's view.

**Adjustable parameters** — Easily configure:

**Radius** — Control how far from the camera the distortion is visible.

**Distortion texture** — Use custom textures to define the distortion pattern.

**Strength** — Adjust how intense the distortion appears.

**Speed** — Control the animation speed of the distortion waves.
